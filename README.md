# LR-to-HR-using-SRGAN-
In order to Enhance the Image Quality, we can increase the number of pixels. More pixels thus more information available. This is Super Resolution-GAN (SRGAN) model which can be r-trained on the custom image dataset. we are improving the Low Resolution image of 32X32 to 128x128.
So there is a 4X increase in the resolution or no. of pixels. we trained the model on the Brain MRI images.
